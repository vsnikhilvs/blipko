// What Blipko is, told to users through the assistant.
//
// This is the product's equivalent of the grounding contract on the money
// tools: the assistant answers "what can you do?" from THIS file, never from
// what the model happens to remember about budgeting apps. A feature described
// here that does not exist is a hallucination with a longer half-life than a
// wrong number — the user acts on it and finds nothing.
//
// KEEP IN SYNC WITH THE CODE, not with README.md. The README currently
// describes an in-chat onboarding wizard that ConnectAccountProcessor replaced
// with a dashboard hand-off, which is exactly the kind of drift this file
// exists to keep out of the model's mouth.
//
// The dashboard URL is passed in rather than written here so it can never
// disagree with env.WEB_APP_URL.

      "Blipko is a personal budget tracker you use by chatting. You text what you spend in plain language and it sorts it into a 50/30/20 budget, tracks what's left, and answers questions about your money. There is no app to install and no forms to fill in.",

    howLoggingWorks:
      'Send what you spent the way you would say it — "chai 30", "auto 80 office", "petrol 500 koduthu". It reads English, Hindi, Hinglish, Malayalam and Manglish, including code-mixed. Voice notes work too: they are transcribed and logged the same way. If the category or bucket is unclear it asks before saving rather than guessing.',

    features: [
      {
        name: "Conversational logging",
        what: "Log a spend by texting or sending a voice note, in everyday mixed-language phrasing.",
        why: "The reason most budgeting apps fail is friction — opening an app and tapping through forms. Texting takes a second, so the habit actually survives past week two.",
      },
      {
        name: "50/30/20 budgeting on a payday cycle",
        what: "Every spend lands in Needs (50%), Wants (30%) or Savings (20%). The split is adjustable, and the cycle runs from your payday rather than the 1st.",
        why: "You see what is left in the pot that matters instead of one meaningless total, and the cycle lines up with when you actually get paid.",

        name: "Categories with monthly limits",
        what: "Spending groups break down into categories (Rent, Groceries, Eating Out, Fuel…), each able to carry its own monthly limit.",
        why: "Shows which specific habit is draining the month, not just that the month was expensive.",

        name: "Boxes — named savings goals",
        what: "Set money aside in named funds (a trip, an emergency fund) and track progress toward a target.",
